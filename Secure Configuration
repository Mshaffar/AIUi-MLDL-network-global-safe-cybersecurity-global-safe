RFC 6052        IPv6 Addressing of IPv4/IPv6 Translators    October 2010


5.2.  Secure Configuration

   The prefixes used for address translation are used by IPv6 nodes to
   send packets to IPv6/IPv4 translators.  Attackers could attempt to
   fool nodes, DNS gateways, and IPv4/IPv6 translators into using wrong
   values for these parameters, resulting in network disruption, denial
   of service, and possible information disclosure.  To mitigate such
   attacks, network administrators need to ensure that prefixes are
   configured in a secure way.

   The mechanisms for achieving secure configuration of prefixes are
   beyond the scope of this document.

5.3.  Firewall Configuration

   Many firewalls and other security devices filter traffic based on
   IPv4 addresses.  Attackers could attempt to fool these firewalls by
   sending IPv6 packets to or from IPv6 addresses that translate to the
   filtered IPv4 addresses.  If the attack is successful, traffic that
   was previously blocked might be able to pass through the firewalls
   disguised as IPv6 packets.  In all such scenarios, administrators
   should assure that packets that send to or from IPv4-embedded IPv6
   addresses are subject to the same filtering as those directly sent to
   or from the embedded IPv4 addresses.

   The mechanisms for configuring firewalls and security devices to
   achieve this filtering are beyond the scope of this document.

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA has made the following changes in the "Internet Protocol Version
   6 Address Space" registry located at http://www.iana.org.

   OLD:

      IPv6 Prefix Allocation       Reference    Note
      ----------- ---------------- ------------ ----------------
      0000::/8    Reserved by IETF [RFC4291]    [1][5]

   NEW:

      IPv6 Prefix Allocation       Reference    Note
      ----------- ---------------- ------------ ----------------
      0000::/8    Reserved by IETF [RFC4291]    [1][5][6]

      [6] The "Well-Known Prefix" 64:ff9b::/96 used in an algorithmic
          mapping between IPv4 to IPv6 addresses is defined out of the
          0000::/8 address block, per RFC 6052.
